# Designing-and-Programming-an-Embedded-Circuit-for-Fault-Detection-of-ESP32-modules

This project addresses the challenge of efficient and secure programming for ESP modules used in various devices. Typically, each ESP module is programmed individually, which is time-consuming and can slow down the production process. Additionally, there's limited protection on the main programming board, leading to possible damage if errors occur in PCB manufacturing, component defects, or assembly faults.

This project aims to solve these issues by designing a product capable of:

1. Programming up to 3 ESP modules simultaneously
2. Protecting the main programming board from potential failures
3. Detecting the health status of each module to streamline the coding and hardware debugging process for technicians

Project Objectives: 

1. USB Port Design: Utilized STM32 microcontroller to design and code a USB port on the board, enabling communication with each of the 3 ESP modules.

2. Multi-Module Programming Board Design: Developed a custom board capable of programming 3 ESP modules concurrently, significantly increasing production efficiency.

3. Protection Mechanisms: Implemented necessary protection to safeguard the main programming board against potential issues, enhancing durability and reliability.

4. Module Health Detection: Integrated diagnostics to determine the operational status of each module, displaying the condition of each on the board to aid technicians in troubleshooting.

Prerequisites:

1. STM32 programming tools such as Keil and Cube IDE
2. ESP modules
3. PCB design software for board schematics
